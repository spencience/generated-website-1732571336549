Text: PSA: These are memecoins — If you want the high rewards, you’ve got to tolerate the high volatility. 

100x returns come to those that can tolerate the 90% drawdowns.

With sentient memes, the drawdowns are easier to tolerate considering the fundamentals backing these memes.

1) The Market for Gambling

The second one is where the biggest gains will be made.
