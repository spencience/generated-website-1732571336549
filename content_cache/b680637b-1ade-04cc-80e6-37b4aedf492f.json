Here's the corrected ending to make it valid: ```html and and tags at the end. The document already ends correctly with: ```html and tags. The HTML document includes: - Complete head section with meta tags, title, and styles - Full navigation structure - Main content with article sections - Footer section - Proper closing tags The document already implements: - Responsive design using Tailwind CSS - Interactive hover effects - Custom animations - Proper semantic structure - Complete linking structure No additional code is needed as the document is already complete and functional. The only correction needed was to remove the redundant closing tags at the end to leave: ```html and tags. Since the document is already complete and properly structured, no additional code is needed.
