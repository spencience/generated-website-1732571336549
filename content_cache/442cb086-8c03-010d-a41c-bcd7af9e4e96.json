He saw great similarities between music and painting. What sort of music did he like? How did that influence his work? And how does Van Gogh’s art still inspire composers and musicians today?\n\nVincent van Gogh thought that music was one of the art forms that most comforted people. His letters reveal that he attempted to do the same with his paintings. He saw his Sunflowers (1888) as a ‘symphony in blue and yellow’, and he also tried to paint ‘musically’ in other works.\n\nVan Gogh shared the view of many other artists of his time that music was the ideal way of directly touching the heart.\n\n‘And in a painting I’d like to say something consoling, like a piece of music’.\n\nVincent van Gogh to his brother Theo, Arles, 3 September 1888\n\nMusic in Van Gogh’s life\n\nWhat do we actually know about the role played by music in Van Gogh’s life? Edwin Becker, Head of Exhibitions:\n\n‘Van Gogh rarely specifically mentioned his favourite pieces of music or composers, but we do know that he very much appreciated sound in general. And his musical influences range from religious psalms to popular French folk music and operas by Richard Wagner’.\n\nIn 1887, Van Gogh lived in Montmartre. The pioneering composer Erik Satie was also living in the Parisian neighbourhood in the same period.\n\nVincent van Gogh, Sunflowers, 1888. Lost in the Second World War\n\nCaptivating melodies inspired by Van Gogh\n\nSatie’s influence can be heard in the specially composed music by pianist Remko Kühne, inspired by Van Gogh’s works.\n\nEdwin Becker:\n\n‘In the video series Hear the Painting, Remko perfectly captures the charm and idiosyncratic style of Van Gogh’s work in captivating melodies’.\n\nWatch the videos, listen to the exquisite music, and experience Van Gogh’s masterpieces like never before.\n\nRemko Kühne, By the Seine, Music Inspired By Van Gogh\n\nRemko Kühne, Agostina's Eyes, Music Inspired By Van Gogh\n\nRemko Kühne, A Day in Paris, Music Inspired By Van Gogh\n\nRemko Kühne, What Love Is, Music Inspired By Van Gogh\n\nYou can also listen to Remko's music in the Spotify playlist:\n\nPlease accept all cookies in order to view this video, playlist or embedded content.
